                <p4> What Is A Nebula? <br> </p4>
                <p5> Nebulae are clouds of gas and dust that can be found throughout our galaxy and beyond. These clouds are often illuminated by nearby stars and can take on a variety of shapes and colors. The most common types of nebulae are emission nebulae, reflection nebulae, and dark nebulae. Emission nebulae are clouds of ionized gas that emit light, often appearing red or pink. Reflection nebulae are clouds of dust that reflect light from nearby stars, appearing blue or silver. Dark nebulae are dense clouds of gas and dust that absorb light, appearing as dark patches against a bright background. Nebulae play an important role in the formation and evolution of stars, as they provide the raw materials necessary for new stars to form. </p5>

                <p4> Famous Nebula <br> </p4>
                <p5> One of the most famous nebulae is the Orion Nebula, which is visible with the naked eye in the constellation Orion. The Orion Nebula is an emission nebula and is one of the closest star-forming regions to Earth, located about 1,500 light-years away. The nebula is home to over 1,000 young stars, including a cluster of four massive stars known as the Trapezium. The Orion Nebula is also known for its intricate filaments and pillars of gas and dust, which are sculpted by the intense radiation and winds from the young stars. The Orion Nebula has been studied extensively by astronomers and is a popular target for amateur astronomers and astrophotographers.</p5>
