                <p4> What are Comets <br> </p4>
                <p5> The Milky Way Galaxy, the celestial structure that houses our solar system, is a barred spiral galaxy of immense proportions, consisting of an estimated 100 billion to 400 billion stars, as well as countless planets, asteroids, and other celestial objects. This massive structure is believed to be about 100,000 light-years in diameter, a distance that is incredibly difficult to comprehend. It is located in the Local Group, a collection of over 54 galaxies, and is situated on the outer edge of this group. The complexity of the galaxy is not limited to its immense size, as its structure and composition have been a topic of scientific inquiry for centuries. The Milky Way Galaxy is home to celestial objects such as: <ul> <li> Stars </li> <li> Planets</li> <li> Asterioids </li>  <li> Comets </li>  <li> Black Holes </li> <li> Nebulae </li> <li> Neutron Stars </li></ul> </p5>

                <p4> Famous Comets <br> </p4>
                <p5> The center of the Milky Way, which is located approximately 27,000 light-years from the Sun, is shrouded in a thick veil of dust, making it a challenge to observe. However, it is believed to contain a supermassive black hole known as Sagittarius A*, which has a mass of approximately 4.1 million times that of the Sun. The Milky Way also exhibits a number of other interesting astronomical phenomena, such as black holes, supernovae, and nebulae. Furthermore, the galaxy is surrounded by a halo of dark matter, an invisible material that is believed to make up around 85% of the matter in the universe. The study of the Milky Way and its various components is an ongoing process that continues to fascinate and perplex astronomers and astrophysicists alike, as they strive to unravel the mysteries of this complex and awe-inspiring structure. </p5>
