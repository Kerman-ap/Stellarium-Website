                <p4> What are Comets <br> </p4>
                <p5> Comets are celestial bodies composed of dust, rock, ice, and gas that orbit the Sun in elongated, elliptical orbits. When comets approach the Sun, they heat up and release gas and dust particles, creating a visible coma (a fuzzy, glowing cloud) and a tail that can stretch millions of kilometers long. Comets are thought to be remnants of the formation of our solar system, and their composition and structure can provide insights into the conditions that existed in the early solar system. Many comets are named after their discoverers or the observatories that first detected them, and they can be seen from Earth with the naked eye or through telescopes. </p5>

                <p4> Famous Comets <br> </p4>
                <p5> One of the most famous comets is Halley's Comet, named after astronomer Edmond Halley who predicted its return in 1758. Halley's Comet is visible from Earth every 76 years, and its appearance has been documented for over 2,000 years. Halley's Comet is known for its distinctive bright, bluish-green coma and two tails that can stretch up to tens of millions of kilometers long. Another famous comet is Comet Hale-Bopp, which was visible to the naked eye for a record-breaking 18 months in 1996-1997. Comet Hale-Bopp was discovered by two amateur astronomers, Alan Hale and Thomas Bopp, and it was notable for its exceptionally bright coma and long, straight tail. Both Halley's Comet and Comet Hale-Bopp captured the public's imagination and sparked widespread interest in astronomy and space exploration. </p5>
