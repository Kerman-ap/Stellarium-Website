                <p4> What Are Asteroids? <br> </p4>
                <p5> Asteroids are small, rocky objects that orbit the Sun and are typically found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Unlike comets, asteroids are made up of rock and metal and do not have a coma or tail. Asteroids are also believed to be remnants from the early solar system, but they are thought to have formed closer to the Sun than comets. Some asteroids are large enough to have their own moons, and some have even been visited by spacecraft, including the Japanese probe Hayabusa2, which recently returned a sample of the asteroid Ryugu to Earth. </p5>

                <p4> Fun Facts About Asteroids <br> </p4>
                <p5> <ol> <li> The largest known asteroid is Ceres, which is about 590 miles (940 km) in diameter and is considered a "dwarf planet." </li> <li> The asteroid that is thought to have caused the extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago was estimated to be about 6 miles (10 km) in diameter. </li> <li> NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft is currently orbiting the asteroid Bennu, collecting samples that will be returned to Earth in 2023. </li> <li> In 2013, a meteoroid exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, causing widespread damage and injuries. The meteoroid was estimated to be about 20 meters in diameter and weighed about 11,000 tons. </li> <li> There are over 1 million known asteroids in our solar system, but scientists believe that there are many more that have yet to be discovered. </li></ol> </p5>
